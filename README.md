# AR Tag Detection and Tracking
This is a coursework project to implement to corner detection, orientation and tag ID of an AR Tag, and superimposing an image and a 3D cube on the AR tag in a given video.

## Overview

In this project, an AR Tag is used to project a 3D cube and Lena image on the tag without using in-built functions such as cv2.findHomography() and cv2.warpPerspective().

## Dependencies

- Python3
- OpenCV-Python
- Numpy
